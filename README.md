## Security Considerations

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This repository contains sensitive configuration files that must NOT be committed to version control.

### Protected Files
- **GoogleService-Info.plist** - Contains OAuth client secrets
- **Any .xcconfig files** - May contain API keys or build secrets
- **Provisioning profiles** - Contain certificates and team IDs

### Before Cloning/Forking
1. The `.gitignore` file protects these sensitive files
2. You'll need to create your own `GoogleService-Info.plist` from Google Cloud Console
3. Never commit authentication credentials or API keys
4. Use environment variables or secure config files for production deployments

### For Contributors
- Always check what files you're staging before commits
- Use `git status` to verify no sensitive files are tracked
- If you accidentally commit secrets, rotate them immediately

## Development Setup

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This repository contains placeholder values for OAuth configuration. See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for complete setup instructions.

### Quick Start
1. Clone the repository
2. Follow the detailed setup guide in [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)
3. Open the project in Xcode and build

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 14+
- iOS 15+ deployment target  
- Google Cloud Console account with APIs enabled
- Your own OAuth 2.0 credentials

### Package Dependencies
The project uses Swift Package Manager with these dependencies (automatically resolved):
- GoogleSignIn-iOS
- AppAuth-iOS  
- GoogleUtilities
- GTMAppAuth

## Design Decisions

### Why Google Sheets?
- Free, reliable backend
- Easy data analysis and sharing
- Multi-device sync out of the box
- No server maintenance required
- Export capabilities built-in

### UI/UX Choices
- **Large touch targets** (44pt minimum) for one-handed use
- **Haptic feedback** for tactile confirmation while holding baby
- **Quick buttons** for common volumes reduce typing
- **Drag gesture** allows fine-tuning without keyboard
- **Simple form layout** for fast data entry

### Technical Choices
- **SwiftUI over UIKit** - Modern, less code, better previews
- **Async/await** - Cleaner than callbacks for API calls
- **@StateObject** for service layer - Proper lifecycle management
- **No external dependencies** beyond Google SDK - Simpler maintenance

## Future Considerations

### Scaling Beyond MVP
**Strategy**: Multi-tier architecture with Google Sheets as privacy-focused basic tier and cost-optimized AWS for advanced analytics.

#### Tier 1: Google Sheets (Current - Privacy Focused)
- **Zero infrastructure costs** - Users pay nothing, data stays in their Google account
- **Maximum privacy** - No third-party data storage, direct user-to-Google API
- **Simple setup** - Just requires Google account and spreadsheet ID
- **Perfect for**: Privacy-conscious users, single-family use, minimal tech setup

#### Tier 2: Premium Analytics (AWS Cloud)
**Cost-Optimized Architecture with Advanced Insights:**

**Database Layer (Cost-Conscious):**
- **DynamoDB** - Pay-per-request model, generous free tier (25GB, 25 WCU/RCU)
- **Skip RDS initially** - DynamoDB handles ~95% of use cases at fraction of cost
- **S3** - Extremely cheap storage for analytics (~$0.023/GB/month)

**Compute Layer (Serverless-First):**
- **Lambda** - 1M requests/month free, then $0.20 per 1M requests
- **API Gateway** - 1M API calls/month free tier
- **EventBridge** - Pay-per-event, minimal cost for feeding notifications

**Cost Projections (1000 active users):**
- **DynamoDB**: ~$5-15/month (generous free tier coverage)
- **Lambda**: ~$2-5/month (most requests covered by free tier)
- **S3**: ~$1-3/month for analytics storage
- **Total**: ~$10-25/month vs $30-100+ for RDS equivalent

#### Phase 1: Cost-Optimized Foundation
- **DynamoDB single table design** - Minimize provisioned throughput costs
- **Lambda + API Gateway** - Serverless backend with pay-per-use pricing
- **Terraform** - Infrastructure as code from day one
- **CloudWatch free tier** - Basic monitoring and logging

#### Phase 2: Premium Analytics Features
- **DynamoDB Streams** - Real-time data processing (included in DynamoDB cost)
- **S3 + Athena** - Query historical data without dedicated analytics database
- **QuickSight SPICE** - $5/user/month only for admin dashboards
- **Lambda analytics** - Custom insights without expensive ML services

**Premium Analytics Capabilities:**
- **Feeding Pattern Analysis** - Growth trends, volume patterns, timing insights
- **Age-Appropriate Comparisons** - Anonymous peer comparisons by age group
- **Predictive Insights** - Next feeding time predictions, growth projections
- **Health Milestone Tracking** - Integration with pediatric feeding guidelines
- **Custom Reports** - Weekly/monthly summaries, pediatrician reports
- **Smart Notifications** - Feeding reminders based on patterns, growth alerts

#### Benefits by Tier
**Google Sheets Tier:**
- Zero cost, maximum privacy, simple setup

**Premium Analytics Tier:**
- Advanced insights, predictive analytics, peer comparisons
- Estimated $10-25/month for 1000+ users vs $0 for Sheets
- Custom dashboards, automated notifications, health milestone tracking
- Privacy-compliant analytics with user consent and data control

### Privacy & Security

#### Current (Google Sheets)
- All data stays in user's own Google account
- No data collected by the app itself
- Direct user-to-Google API communication

#### Future (AWS Infrastructure)
- **Encryption at rest and in transit** - All data encrypted using AWS KMS
- **HIPAA compliance considerations** - For health data protection
- **User data isolation** - Each user's data in separate logical partitions
- **Face ID/Touch ID** - Biometric app access for sensitive health data
- **Data retention policies** - Configurable retention with automatic cleanup
- **Audit logging** - CloudTrail for all data access and modifications
- **Privacy controls** - User data export, deletion, and consent management
